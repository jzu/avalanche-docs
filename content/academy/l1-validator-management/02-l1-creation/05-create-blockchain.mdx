Now that we have the genesis file created, we can add a chain to the Subnet that you've created
earlier. You will do this by issuing a `CreateChainTx` on the P-Chain. This will create the P-Chain
record for your blockchain and associate it with the Subnet. The `CreateChainTx` transaction has the
following parameters:

- `name`: The name of the chain
- `subnetID`: The ID of the Subnet you want to add the chain to
- `vmID`: The ID of the Virtual Machine that will be used to run the chain
- `genesisData`: The genesis configuration of the chain

The blockchain will be uniquely identified by the transaction hash of the `CreateChainTx` transaction.

### Virtual Machine (VM) Configuration

When creating your blockchain, you'll need to specify the appropriate Virtual Machine ID:

- For standard [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm) chains, use the default VM ID: `srEXiWaHuhNyGwPUi444Tu47ZEDwxTWrbQiuD7FmgSAQ6X7Dy`
- If you're deploying a custom VM (such as `subnet-evm` with custom precompiles or a `hypersdk`-based chain), you must specify the correct custom VM ID

### Creating Your Blockchain

Use the interactive tool below to complete the blockchain creation process:

import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "../../../../toolbox/src/demo/ui/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx"
import CreateChain from "../../../../toolbox/src/demo/examples/L1/CreateChain.tsx"

<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
    <CreateChain />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

When the transaction was submitted successfully, you can head to the [P-Chain Explorer for the Fuji
testnet](https://subnets-test.avax.network/p-chain) and search for the transaction hash to verify
the creation of the blockchain.

An endpoint to query the blockchain details via the Avalanche API will be available shortly.
