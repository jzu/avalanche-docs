The genesis file of your blockchain contains critical configurations determines how your blockchain
will operate and sets various parameters that will govern its behavior. These configurations
include:

- Chain ID: A unique identifier for your blockchain
- Native Token Allocation: How many tokens are allocated to each address at genesis
- Fee Configuration: Parameters that govern transaction fees and block production
- Precompiles: Which precompiled contracts are enabled and their configurations
- Network Upgrades: Activation times for new features and changes

With this tool below you can create a simple genesis file for your EVM blockchain. We use many
default values for configurations not relevant for this course. Native tokens are allocated to your
currently connected wallet. You can customize the genesis file further by editing the JSON directly.
