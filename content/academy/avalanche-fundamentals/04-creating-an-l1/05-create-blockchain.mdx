In this section you will learn how to create a blockchain record on the P-Chain. First we will learn
how to use the Genesis Builder tool to configure the blockchain. Then you will issue the
`CreateChainTx` on the P-Chain to create the blockchain record. The `CreateChainTx` transaction as the following
parameters:

- `name`: The name of the chain
- `subnetID`: The ID of the Subnet you want to add the chain to
- `vmID`: The ID of the Virtual Machine that will be used to run the chain.
- `genesisData`: The genesis configuration of the chain

The Genesis Builder tool allows us to configure many aspects of the blockchain like permissioning,
it's tokenonomics and the transaction fee mechanism. 

Feel free to browse through the different configuration options, but for now don't change any of the
defaults and just click the `View Genesis JSON` button.

Then click `Create Chain` This will create the P-Chain record for your blockchain and associate it
with the Subnet created in the previous step. 

The blockchain will be uniquely identified by the transaction hash of the `CreateChainTx` transaction.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a blockchain record on the P-Chain. The blockchain does not
have any validator nodes yet, so we can't connect our wallet to it or issue any transactions just
yet. You will learn how to do that in the next section.
