Now that the P-Chain records are set up, you can start the nodes tracking the Subnet. 

## Generate the Docker Command

There are many flags for the docker image. The tool below will help you navigate the configuration
options and generates the docker command for you based on the subnetID. Copy the docker command and
run in the terminal of your node.

<AvalancheGoDocker />


### Follow Node Logs

To check the logs of AvalancheGo, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker logs -f avago
```

After the node has been started it will take a few minutes to sync the P-Chain.

### Stop Node

To stop the node, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker stop avago
```

The node credentials and the blockchain state is persisted in the `~/.avalanchego` directory. When
you restart the node it will pick up where it left off.

### Remove Node

```bash
docker rm avago
```

This will not remove the state and credentials of the node. To remove these you need to delete the `~/.avalanchego` directory.
