description: Learn how to use the WarpMessenger Precompile on your Avalanche L1 blockchain.

## Overview

The `WarpMessenger` Precompile is used to perform cross chain operations among Avalanche L1s.

Warp Precompile enables cross-blockchain communication between other Layer 1s and primary-network (C-Chain) by leveraging the Avalanche P-Chain. In order to use Warp messaging, Subnet-EVM chains must activate their Warp precompiles.

## Activating the Precompile

Warp can be activated with the following lines in upgrade.json:

```json
{
  "warpConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": (uint),
    "quorumNumerator": (uint)
  }
}
```

`blockTimestamp` must be set to a timestamp after Durango date. `quorumNumerator` is the stake percentage of validators that must sign a Warp message for it to be considered valid. It must be set to a value between 33 and 100. The default value is 67. The `warpConfig` precompile can be later disabled by setting `disable` to `true` in the upgrade.json file.

If you want to use Warp messaging in an existing Subnet-EVM chain, you should coordinate an upgrade with `upgrade.json`.

## Interface and Address

The WarpMessenger precompile is located at address `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000005` and implements the following interface:

interface IWarpMessenger {

  // sendWarpMessage emits a request for the subnet to send a warp message from [msg.sender]

  // it is willing to sign for an off-chain relayer to aggregate Warp signatures.
  function sendWarpMessage(bytes calldata payload) external returns (bytes32 messageID);

  // getVerifiedWarpMessage parses the pre-verified warp message in the
  // predicate storage slots as a WarpMessage and returns it to the caller.

  // and true.
  // Otherwise, returns false and the empty value for the message.
  function getVerifiedWarpMessage(uint32 index) external view returns (WarpMessage calldata message, bool valid);

  function getVerifiedWarpBlockHash(
    uint32 index
  ) external view returns (WarpBlockHash calldata warpBlockHash, bool valid);

  // getBlockchainID returns the snow.Context BlockchainID of this chain.
  // This blockchainID is the hash of the transaction that created this blockchain on the P-Chain
  // and is not related to the Ethereum ChainID.
  function getBlockchainID() external view returns (bytes32 blockchainID);
}
```

## Implementation

You can find the implementation of the WarpMessenger precompile in the [subnet-evm repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/precompile/contracts/warp/contract.go).
